Title: Implementing Many-to-Many RNN for English-to-Urdu Language
Translation and Exploring Its Limitations
Part 1: Many-to-Many Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) Implementation
Objective:
Implement a many-to-many RNN model for English-to-Urdu language translation using a
publicly available dataset.
Public Dataset:
Use the parallel-corpus.xlsx parallel corpus for English-Urdu translation. The dataset includes
parallel sentences in English and Urdu, which can be used for training and evaluation.
Tasks:
1. Data Preparation:
o Download the parallel-corpus.xlsx dataset.
o Preprocess your data in both English and Urdu.
o Split the dataset into training, validation, and test sets.
2. Model Architecture:
o Build an RNN-based many-to-many architecture using TensorFlow or PyTorch.
o Train the model for English-to-Urdu translation.
3. Evaluation:
o Evaluate the model using appropriate metrics like BLEU score or accuracy.
o Provide example translations for a few test sequences.
Instructions:
• Submission will be Online. Submit python file(s) with single word file containing report
and code with Screenshots of running codes.
• Late submissions are not allowed.
• Solve all the questions in the given order.
• Write the programs with clarity and add comments where necessary.
• Each question carries 10 marks.
• The evaluation will be viva based with binary marking.
• This is a group assignment. Maximum 2 persons are allowed.

Part 2: Reporting the Limitations of RNNs
Objective:
Discuss the limitations of RNNs in the context of language translation.
Tasks:
1. Limitations to Discuss:
o The challenge of handling long sequences due to exploding/vanishing gradients.
o Difficulty in capturing long-term dependencies between words, especially for
languages with complex grammatical structures like Urdu.
o Poor performance on large datasets with complex language pairs.
o Show examples of each scenario generated from dataset.
